#Create a funciton that takes a dictionary of users and returns a dictionary of tasks, where each task is associated with the users who worked on the task.
#First create a new dictionary.
#Iterate the input dictionary, adding the values to the new dictionary

#inputs: dictionary of users with values as a dictionary of tasks
#outputs: dictionary of tasks with a dictionary of users as values
